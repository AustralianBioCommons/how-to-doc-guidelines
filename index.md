## Why do the [documentation guidelines](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines) exist?

**Do you want your tools and workflows to be documented in a standard way?**

**If the answer is yes, then read on!**

The Australian BioCommons has been working with community bioinformaticians and our infrastructure partners to establish a guidelines repository that can act as a template for documentation of tools and workflows.

The repository aims to provide guidance and a minimal starting template for:

- Documenting a new [tool](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/tools.md) or [workflow](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/workflows.md)
- Documenting tool or workflow access, use and [optimisation on infrastructures](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md)
- Recommending additional repository contents that make your work more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

>The Australian BioCommons guidelines are based on learnings from existing efforts, including our own projects, but also the Galaxy, NextFlow and Snakemake communities.
