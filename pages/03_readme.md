### 1. Replace the repository `README.md`

A README.md is the explainer file for your software or project. 

If you have cloned / copied this repository, you need to replace this README with either: 

1. One of the templates from the `documentation templates` directory:
   1. Rename the template documentation file to `README.md`,
   2. Move the file into the root directory of the repository,
   3. Complete the necessary sections of the template, and 
   4. Delete the other headings


2. Create your own custom README content @ https://readme.so/

These are the current templates that are available in `documentation_templates/`:
- `tools.md`: template for documenting software tools.
- `workflows.md`: template for documenting computational workflows.
- `infrastructure_optimisation.md`: template for documenting software optimisation required for specific compute infrastructures (cloud, HPC, other).
- `benchmarking.md`: template for documenting benchmarking outcomes for software.
