title: Update your README contents
type: steps
description: Add a plain text description here.

A `README.md` is the explainer file for your software or project. 

You have two options for updating its contents depending on if you have cloned the documentation guidelines to create a new repository, or if you need to update an existing repository. 

## Creating a new repository

In this case:

1. Select a template from the `documentation templates` directory 
2. Move the template file into the root directory of the repository, 
3. Complete the necessary sections of the template, 
4. Delete the other headings, and
5. When ready, delete the original `README.md` file from the template repository and rename your completed documentation as `README.md`.


## Updating an existing repository

You can do two things here, either copy the contents of one of the template documentation files into your existing `README.md` file, or you can use existing resources like https://readme.so/ to create your own custom README content. 

These are the current templates that are available in `documentation_templates/`:
- `tools.md`: template for documenting software tools.
- `workflows.md`: template for documenting computational workflows.
- `infrastructure_optimisation.md`: template for documenting software optimisation required for specific compute infrastructures (cloud, HPC, other).
- `benchmarking.md`: template for documenting benchmarking outcomes for software.
