## Keep it simple

Only add the directories and structures that are needed, and highlight the purpose of each one.


## Ensure your documentation is straightforward and easy to understand



## Delete elements of the template that you do not need

These are guidelines only, and that means you can modify, update or delete elements of the file and directory structure to suit your specific use case.
