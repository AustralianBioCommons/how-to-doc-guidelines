## Is there a way to let people know how my repository should be cited?

The [documentation guidelines](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines) include a `CITATION.cff` file to highlight 
how the repository and its contents should be cited. 

> Druskat, Stephan, Spaaks, Jurriaan H., Chue Hong, Neil, Haines, Robert, Baker, James, Bliven, Spencer, Willighagen, Egon, Pérez-Suárez, David, & Konovalov, Alexander. (2021). **Citation File Format (1.2.0)**. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171937

Below is an example of this file format being used by the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub.html). 
The file is available [here](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/GermlineShortV_biovalidation/blob/main/CITATION.cff).
