## Should I contribute to an existing community workflow effort instead?

The [BioCommons guideline](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines) is based on learnings from multiple community efforts including the Galaxy [Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc), [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) and [Snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows).

If you are using Galaxy, Nextflow or Snakemake workflow languages and would like to contribute to their community workflow efforts, **you could be using their specific guidelines**, which are linked to below.
