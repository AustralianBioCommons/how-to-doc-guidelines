type: options
description: Add a plain text description here.

These guidelines are a minimal exemplar that can be used as a template for your software project.

There are other options that will allow you to achieve documentation best practice. Examples of these options are provided here.


## Create custom documentation


## Use automated documentation tools


## Contribute to a community effort


### Software

| Community effort | Link |
|:----:|:----:|
|||



### Workflows

The [BioCommons guideline](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines) is based on learnings from multiple community efforts including the Galaxy [Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc), [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) and [Snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows).

If you are using Galaxy, Nextflow or Snakemake workflow languages and would like to contribute to their community workflow efforts, **you could be using their specific guidelines**, which are linked to below:

| Community effort | Workflow language documentation | Workflow guideline information | How to create / contribute new workflows |
